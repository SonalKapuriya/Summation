**How Customer Churn prediction Works**
Customer churn analysis can be accomplished by fitting statistical models to historical data and trying to find a pattern in customers that may result in churn. Forward-thinking organizations are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to forecast future trends and behaviors and identify previously hidden indicators that help to predict churn.
Here Deep Learning Neural network is used for the prediction.
